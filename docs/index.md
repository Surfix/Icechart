**A python package for icesat data analysis**


-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: <https://Surfix.github.io/icechart>
    

## Features

Icechart is a python library developed to simplify the querying, acquisition and analysis of major satellite altimetry data (such as icesat-2, cryosat-2) towards facilitating scientific discovery and insights into the ice and snow covered regions. In its full development, the package will provide the following features:

- Convert spatial data format between shapefile to GeoJSON
- Display Earth Engine data layers for interactive mapping.
- Support Earth Engine JavaScript API-styled functions in Python, such as Map.addLayer(), Map.setCenter(), Map.centerObject(), Map.setOptions().
- Retrieve satellite altimetry data around user defined ROI from NSIDC platform
- Add the data to interactive map
- Plot and analyze the data
